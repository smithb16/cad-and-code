  <p>
    <strong>Features </strong>This system does not fully automate the trip
    booking process. It instead replaces administrative copy-pasting, generating
    documents from trip information stored in a central location. The system
    performs the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Generates a guide-facing Google Calendar event containing relevant links,
      client information, and trip details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Generates a Google Form and associated results spreadsheet to collect
      client information (medical details, climbing experience, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Sends custom trip confirmation email to clients containing guide details,
      meeting location details, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sends pre-trip reminder emails to the guide, and generates messages for
      easier guide-client communication.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allows for additional groups and additional guides to be added to trip
      after initial trip booking.
    </li>
    <li>
      System was developed with minimal coding to facilitate maintenance by
      guide service administrators rather than software engineers.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Airtable </strong>Our Airtable relational databases contain
    information about our clients, guides, meeting locations, and trip
    offerings. The Airtable button features allow us to instantly take action on
    a trip, such as adding a new group to an existing trip. Airtable easily
    integrates with Zapier.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Zapier </strong>Zapier is the glue that connects all pieces in this
    system. Zapier is a visual API, allowing Airtable, Google Forms, Google
    Drive, and Gmail to communicate with each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Google Apps Script </strong>This system uses Google Apps Script, a
    derivative of JavaScript, for advanced automated editing of Google objects.
    The script receives JSON objects via POST requests and modifies existing
    Google Forms and Calendar events accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Phase 3: Profit </strong>This system reduced the per-trip
    administrative time by 60% and, more importantly, eliminated copy-paste
    errors. Administrators can manually modify all documents before delivery to
    the client, useful for one-off needs. The guide service's administrators now
    use their time for projects that are more interesting than copy-pasting.
