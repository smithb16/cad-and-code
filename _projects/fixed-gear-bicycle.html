preview-blurb: When I couldn't find the bike I wanted, I decided I'd build one myself. I designed and welded this steel frame and outfitted it with components.

    <strong>Geometry</strong> Using a combination of online research, personal
    measurements, and sitting on other peoples' bikes, I defined my frame
    geometry and built it in CAD. The resulting frame fits me well and matches
    the road/track style I was aiming for.

    <strong>Fabrication</strong> I notched the steel tubes with a hole-saw jig
    and fixtured the bike on a custom frame jig. I TIG welded the frame,
    followed by bottom-bracket thread chasing and head and seat tube reaming.
    Reaming tubes is the most challenging process without specialized
    bike-building tools. Paint struggled to stick to the polished steel tubes (I
    tried), so I finished the frame with clear powder-coating.

    <strong>Assembly</strong> I bought components and bolted them on. This is
    much easier with only one gear. If the design and fabrication steps went
    well, this process feels like downhill work.

    <strong>Riding</strong> The bike rides great and fits me well. My longest
    ride is 80 miles and was not limited by the bike.
