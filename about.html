<div class="bio-content">
  <p>
    I never remember learning "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey". By the age of six,
    I'd turned enough screws to know that's just how they worked. By eight, I
    was welding. By 10, I ran the mill and lathe in our garage. That I would
    learn mechanical engineering as a trade is not surprising. What I do find
    surprising is how long it took me to enjoy the wider world of engineering,
    including the process itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've always been one to toe the line between hobby and obsession. Many of
    the projects highlighted on this site, including this site itself, are an
    output of this behavior. Topics where I've learned and practiced include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hardware</strong>: test fixtures, motorcycles, camper vans.</li>
    <li><strong>Software</strong>: Vim, Rails, Python.</li>
    <li><strong>Climbing</strong>: rock, ice, big-wall, alpine.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical fitness</strong>: lifting, running, training.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking</strong>: sous vide & vegetables.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I'm not the best engineer out there. Advanced math confuses me, and I've
    taken too many excursions into climbing, running, baking, or weight lifting
    when I could have been machining, coding, making, and troubleshooting.
    However, my coworkers would say I'm
    <strong>at my best when the problems are murkiest</strong>. They might also
    say I'm <strong>fun to work with</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>As an engineer, I believe that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using the right tool for the job sets the project up for success, and it
      helps to know many different tools. You could divide with mechanical logic
      gates, but a computer is usually the right tool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designs and ideas should be rigorously tested. Testing at all levels (e.g.
      component, sub and full-system) highlights where a design needs
      improvement, and provides better feedback than analytic calculations and
      simulations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Testing must happen in a nurturing environment, one that encourages
      tweaking over scrapping. No solutions work the first time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Customers don't ride spec sheets, they ride motorcycles. If you want to
      know which motorcycle is best, get your helmet, not your computer.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a human, I believe that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It is important to do hard things. I start by lifting heavy weights.
    </li>
    <li>
      Humans, myself included, are destroying the planet, and technology (e.g.
      carbon sequestration, nuclear fusion) will exacerbate the situation. We
      should not colonize Mars.
    </li>
    <li>
      We cannot, however, ignore or scorn technology. We should instead call out
      its downsides. Those who scorned the Iron Age no longer have a say.
    </li>
    <li>
      We work better with face-to-face interactions, concrete examples, local
      conflicts, and local solutions. We struggle the abstract and the
      universal.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Books that have strongly influenced me include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Incerto Series</strong> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</li>
    <li><strong>Boyd</strong> by Robert Coram</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Training for the New Alpinism</strong> by Steve House & Scott
      Johnston
    </li>
  </ul>
