    I never remember learning "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey". By the age of six,
    I'd turned enough screws to know that's just how they worked. By eight, I
    was welding. By 10, I ran the mill and lathe in our garage. That I would
    learn mechanical engineering as a trade is not surprising. What I do find
    surprising is how long it took me to enjoy the wider world of engineering,
    including the process itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've always been one to toe the line between hobby and obsession. Many of
    the projects highlighted on this site, including this site itself, are an
    output of this behavior. Topics where I've learned and practiced include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Climbing</strong>: rock, ice, big-wall, alpine.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical fitness</strong>: lifting, running, training.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking</strong>: sous vide & vegetables.</li>
    <li><strong>Software</strong>: Vim, Rails, Python.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I'm not the best engineer out there. Advanced math confuses me, and I've
    taken too many excursions into climbing, running, baking, or weight lifting
    when I could have been machining, coding, making, or troubleshooting.
    However, my coworkers would say I'm
    <strong>at my best when the problems are murkiest</strong>. They might also
    say I'm <strong>fun to work with</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>As an engineer, I believe that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using the right tool for the job sets the project up for success, and it
      helps to know many different tools. One can divide with mechanical logic
      gates, but a calculator (or Python script) is the right tool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designs and ideas should be rigorously tested in a nurturing environment.
      Testing at all levels (e.g. component, sub and full-system) highlights
      where a design needs improvement, and provides better feedback than
      analytic calculations and simulations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Customers don't ride a spec sheet, they ride a motorcycle. If you want to
      know which motorcycle is best, get your helmet, not your computer.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a human, I believe that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It is important to do hard things. I start by lifting heavy weights.
    </li>
    <li>
      Humans, myself included, are destroying the planet, and technology (e.g.
      carbon sequestration, nuclear fusion) will exacerbate the situation. We
      should not colonize Mars.
    </li>
    <li>
      We cannot, however, ignore or scorn technology. We should call out its
      downsides, but those who scorned the Iron Age no longer have a say.
    </li>
    <li>
      We work better with face-to-face interactions, concrete examples, local
      conflicts, and local solutions. We struggle the abstract and the
      universal.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Books that have strongly influenced me include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Incerto Series</strong> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</li>
    <li><strong>Boyd</strong> by Robert Coram</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Training for the New Alpinism</strong> by Steve House & Scott
      Johnston
    </li>
  </ul>
